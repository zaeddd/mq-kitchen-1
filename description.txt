Description for Login System with Email Verification

This project implements a secure login system with email verification functionality. It is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with PHPMailer used specifically for handling email verification.

Key Features:

1. Registration Page:
   - Users can sign up by providing their email address, username, and password.
   - Client-side validation ensures that valid email formats are used and passwords meet the required criteria (e.g., minimum length).
   - Upon successful registration, an email verification link is sent to the provided email address.

2. Email Verification:
   - PHPMailer is used to send an email with a verification link to the user's email address.
   - The verification link contains a unique token or code that expires after a set period (e.g., 24 hours).
   - Clicking on the verification link validates the user's email address and activates their account.

3. Login Page:
   - Registered users can log in using their email and password combination.
   - Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database to ensure user data security.

4. Dashboard:
   - Upon successful login, users are redirected to a dashboard page where they can access their account information or perform specific actions based on the application's functionality.

5. Forgot Password:
   - In case users forget their passwords, a "Forgot Password" feature can be implemented where a password reset link is sent to their registered email address.

Technologies Used:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend development.
- PHP for server-side scripting and backend logic.
- PHPMailer for handling email verification and sending emails securely.
- MySQL or another suitable database for storing user credentials and account information.

Security Measures:

- User passwords are hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storing in the database.
- Email verification ensures that only validated email addresses can access the system, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- Session management and CSRF protection are implemented to prevent common security threats.

Team Collaboration:

This project is a group effort, requiring collaboration among team members to ensure seamless integration of frontend and backend components. Version control systems like Git can be utilized for code management and coordination.

Deployment:

After development and testing phases, the login system can be deployed on a web server with appropriate configurations for PHP and email functionality.
